# go-accelerator

This repository is a template to easily kickstart Go projects. It contains a basic CRUD application
that communicates with a MySQL database.

It depends on [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) and [Gorm](https://gorm.io/index.html).
It follows the most commonly used [Go project layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).
